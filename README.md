## Installation

1. Verify that you are using **Tiny Theme 1.5.1** or later
2. Install from the Micro.blog plugins page
3. **(Optional)** Change the text from "Read More" to anything else on the plugin setting page

That's it!

### How to Use

In Micro.blog, if your post has a title, it will be truncated (shown as a summary) on the home page automatically. Optionally, you can manually define the truncation point by inserting `<!--more-->` in your post.
