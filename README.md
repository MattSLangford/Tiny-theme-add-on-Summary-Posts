# Tiny-theme-add-on-Summary-Posts
Change the default home page and category page layout to show summary posts instead of full posts.

**NOTE**: This plugin is designed for use with the Tiny Theme on Micro.blog.

![Tiny Theme Summary Posts](https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-theme-add-on-Summary-Posts/blob/main/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

## Installation

1. Verify that you are using **Tiny Theme 1.5.1** or later
2. Install from the Micro.blog plugins page
3. **(Optional)** Change the text from "Read More" to anything else on the plugin setting page

That's it!

### How to Use

In Micro.blog, if your post has a title, it will be truncated (shown as a summary) on the home page and category pages automatically. Optionally, you can manually define the truncation point by inserting `<!--more-->` in your post.

### Support Development

Tiny Theme and its plugins are provided free of charge to Micro.blog users. I do not receive payment from Micro.blog in any way. If you'd like to help offset expenses and ensure the future of Tiny and its plugins, please consider supporting its development.
